# dutch-bro-data-analysis

In this project, I will be using a dataset found on Kaggle. The link to this dataset is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/dutch-bros-locations-geolocation-data-for-us?select=DutchBrosLocations20211025.csv

I am building a visualisation tool to visualise Dutch Bros location around the US
